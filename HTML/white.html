From the innocence of youth to the wisdom of old age, the color white represents a plethora of familiar concepts in the English language. The earliest origin of the word white itself, however, is shrouded in a haze of mystery.

Etymologists, or language experts, believe the word white got its start in Proto-Indo-European, a tongue that died out thousands of years ago but gave birth to many modern languages, including English, Welsh, Lithuanian, and Armenian. There’s no written evidence of the Indo-European language, so experts are forced to make the educated guess that the word for white was kwintos.

This ancient word then entered another defunct language called Proto-Germanic. Like its predecessor, the word for white in Proto-Germanic is lost, so etymologists hypothesize that word was khwitaz.

Over time, the word became hwit, which looks and sounds much closer to the white we use today. Hwit is on Old English word, spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, German tribes who began to invade England as early as the 5th century.

The Anglo-Saxons weren’t just the barbarian tribes we sometimes see portrayed in movies and books. They were also quite literate, producing authors like Bede and epic adventures like Beowulf. It’s through this culture that we have some of the first written evidence of the word that would become white. The Anglo-Saxons were also the first to start using the word white as a surname for a person who had light hair or a fair complexion.

Today, variations of white—all with their root in the ancient Proto-Indo-European language—are found in 20 languages around the world, including Sanskrit and Slavic.

White is the color of objects that completely reflect (diffusely) all visible light of all colors, and is therefore the lightest color and the opposite of black (with shades of gray falling in between).[1] Fresh snow and many bleached fibers are white, or shades of white.[2] In many cultures white can signify purity, innocence, and figurative lightness, while black represents the symbolic opposite of these.

Light with a spectral composition that stimulates all three types of the color-sensitive cone cells of the human eye in nearly equal amounts, for example sunlight, appears white. White is one of the most common colors in nature, for example it is the color of whole milk and of limestone (including chalk) and many other opaque minerals that absorb very little of the light (across the visible spectrum) that they scatter.

According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude.[3] White is an important color for almost all world religions. The Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. In Islam, and in the Shinto religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims; and by the Brahmins in India. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.[4]

In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity; the widows of kings dressed in white rather than black as the color of mourning. It sometimes symbolizes royalty; it was the color of the French kings (black being the color of the queens) and of the monarchist movement after the French Revolution as well as of the movement called the White Russians (not to be confounded with Belarus, literally "White Russia") who fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity, simplicity and strength.

The white color on television screens and computer monitors is created with the RGB color model by combining red, green and blue lights (serving as additive primary colors) at their maximum brightnesses
