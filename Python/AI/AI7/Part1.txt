1. Given the following, can you prove the unicorn is mythical? How about Magical? and Horned? (adapted from Barwise and Etchemendy (1993)).
if the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal, but if it is not mythical, then it is a mortal mammal. If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is horned. The unicorn is magical if it is horned.

unicorn is mythical = A
it is immortal = B
It is a mammal = C
It is horned = D
it is magical = E

A --> B
~A --> ~B ^ C
B V C --> D
D --> E

1. Is mythical if its immortal.  No not provable
2. Magical if it is horned.  Yes provable
3. Horned if immortal or mammal. Yes provable

2. Which of the following are correct?
False |= True
True |= False
(A^B)|=(A<->B)
A<->B|=AvB
A<->B|=~AvB
(AvB)^(~AvB) is satisfiable

1. True, False is conditional to True.
2. False
3. True, if A^B then A<-> is subcategory of A^B
4. False, is biconditional and therefore not limited
5. False, Similar to 4
6. True, (¬AvB) is equal to B so is satisfiable
